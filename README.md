This is a simple implementation of the VF2 algorithm.

The VF2 algorithm is used for (sub)graph isomorphism task.

The VF2 paper is in the doc directory.

Actually, this is the homework of the Graph Data Management course in Peking University.
Since I don't have gold answers to the queries yet, the correctness of the code is not guaranteed. (I only manually checked a few results produced by this code, and it seems fine up to now) 
Therefore, please don't use this code directly in product environment.
